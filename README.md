### QA-Project-App
## Objective for this Project

To create a simple app consisting of three services that function together. the idea is based on providing a list of information for each of the services once each individual one is chosen but are interlinked so can be amended when ever needed.

## Technologies used:

Python, Flask, Jenkins, Git, Docker, Azure, Linux

## Concept of the app

The concept of the app i have chosen for this project is based on a fitness industry known training split in bodybuilding known as push, pull, legs. Idea is to have a table of each with a list of exercises for each of push, pull and legs.

## Planning and Project Managament

I used Trello as the service to manage my project. This service helped keep tasks managed and structure throughout the lifespan of the project.

## ERD

## Problems/Issues

I was able to get the webhook working with jenkins and build shell with a successful working console output, however i struggled getting docker files working correectly as well as accessing the app through ports. there is still plenty of configuring needed to get this app working fully.
